# Resolution is not authority

"Where is this agent right now?" and "may I use it?" are different questions. Most designs answer them in the same hop — and that hop is where a compromised resolver becomes an authority.

## Day 13 of 21 · The missing layer

We treat four concerns as independent: **naming** (does it have a human name?), **listing** (does a registry carry it?), **resolution** (can I learn how to reach it?), **inbound admission** (will it accept my request?). Any combination is legal. A nameless agent can be resolvable. A named agent can be unreachable. None of the four is authority.

The ontology keeps them apart on purpose. Agent resolution — *where* — has its own namespace, separate from intent resolution — *which agent satisfies this ask*. Two different classes for two different questions, so a design cannot drift into treating "I found it" as "it fits" or "I may."

**Resolution** is answered by a signed service publication: the agent's own statement of where it is served — surfaces (protocol, URI, exposure, audience, region, priority), transport-key bindings, endpoint-control proofs — with three properties that matter:

— **Sequenced and hash-chained.** Monotonic sequence plus the previous publication's digest: the anti-rollback axis. A resolver *selects* a publication for its audience; it never edits one. A compromised resolver can serve only a stale or wrong-audience record, and both fail the checks.

— **Expiring.** An expiry is required. An unexpiring publication cannot be shown to be current. (NANDA's TTL — signed by the agent rather than the index.)

— **Per-audience channels.** Public, private-with-audience, or pairwise. Pairwise channels carry their own sequence numbers, so two counterparties cannot correlate that they talk to the same infrastructure.

**Private resolution** for unlisted agents uses opaque, recipient-bound grants the agent issues — not salted names. Such a grant answers "may this party *discover* how to reach me?" and nothing else.

Now the rule the field keeps violating: **a resolver never mints authority.** NANDA's adaptive resolver may "issue temporary credentials or endpoint tokens," and its blueprint makes the resolver "itself a registered and trusted agent." That puts an authority in the call path every client must trust. In our model whatever a resolver returns is an *address*. Admission happens at the edge against the caller's own credentials and mandate. Nothing the resolver says can widen what the callee accepts.

**The line:** a resolver returns addresses, never credentials.

Where NANDA is ahead: routing agility — rotating endpoint pools, geo-aware dispatch, TTL tiers by volatility. Our publication has the fields (priority, region, tenant routing hint) and no engine behind them yet. That is the part of their design we would adopt first, as a projection target, with the invariant above intact.

**Question:** In your stack, can a compromised resolver widen what a callee will accept? How would you know?
